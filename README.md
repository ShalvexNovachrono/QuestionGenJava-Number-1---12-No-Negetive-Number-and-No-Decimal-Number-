# Question Generator

This is a simple Java program for generating mathematical questions based on user experience points (XP). The program randomly selects a mathematical operation and a number based on the user's XP level, and then generates a question accordingly.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in your Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the `QuestionGen.java` file.
4. The program will print a randomly generated question based on your XP level.

## How It Works

The `QuestionGen` class contains methods for generating different types of mathematical questions, including division, multiplication, addition, and subtraction. The `qMaker` method selects a random operation and number based on the user's XP level, then calls the appropriate question-making method. The generated question is printed to the console.
